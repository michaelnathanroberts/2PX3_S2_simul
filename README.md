A simulation for an intersection controlled by a traffic light. 
This simulation accounts for cars and similar vehicles, rapid transit, cyclists and similar vehicles, and pedestrians.

This simulation was completed for the second (of three) sprints for my undergraduate second-year engineering design and
communication course (ENGINEER 2PX3) at McMaster University. A pseudocode simulation was also acceptable. 
The overwhelming majority of teams chose to write pseudocode instead of code for the simulation.
