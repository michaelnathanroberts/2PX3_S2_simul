A simulation for a intersection controlled by a traffic light. 
This simulation accounts for cars and similar vehicles, rapid transit, cyclists and similar vehicles, and pedestrians.
This simulation was completed for my undergraduate second-year engineering design and communication course (ENGINEER 2PX3) at McMaster University.
